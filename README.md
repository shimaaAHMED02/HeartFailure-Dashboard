# Heart Failure Dashboard

## Description
### this project has two parts :
1. *apply insights about data* 
2. *apply ml model to predict poitive or negative disease*

### the First part 
- we made an analytical analysis for the data and got some figures representing the relationship of the heart_disease with various features (age , sex , chest pain)
- we used Dash to make an interactive dashboard to visualize our results (as in the images)
- the dashboard is interactive i.e: you can change the parameters to visualize only a part of the data

### the Second part
> * make data pre-processing
> * apply correlation to know the most effective features on output
> * split data to train/test
> * using logistic regression model
> * save model as a pickle file
> * load the model 
> * make prediction for the input data row from user
